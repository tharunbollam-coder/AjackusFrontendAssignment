## 🤔 Reflection

### 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Managing state updates across pages **without a backend or localStorage**
- Building reusable, clean code using only **Vanilla JavaScript**
- Ensuring the interface was **responsive** and professional-looking

### 🌱 What I’d Improve with More Time

- Add **inline form validations**
- Implement UI animations or transitions for better UX
- Add **bulk delete** or **CSV export** options
- Use **localStorage or IndexedDB** if long-term data storage was allowed
- Refactor into a **SPA using React** for smoother routing and state management

## ⚡ Bonus: Fast Turnaround

> 🏁 This entire project was completed and tested in just **4 hours 30 minutes**.

- Thoughtfully planned and structured
- Built every feature from scratch using clean HTML/CSS/JS
- Fully tested across screen sizes

✅ This demonstrates my ability to **deliver quickly** without sacrificing code quality or user experience.
